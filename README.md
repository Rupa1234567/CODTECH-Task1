Overview of the Project 

Project : SIMPLE CALCULATOR

The `BasicCalculator` program in Java uses several methods and constructs to function:

1. **`Scanner` Class**: Utilized to get user input from the console. The `Scanner` object, `scanner`, reads input using methods like `nextDouble()` for reading double values and `nextInt()` for reading integer values.

2. **`System.out.print` and `System.out.println`**: Used to display prompts and messages to the user. `print` displays text without a newline, while `println` adds a newline at the end.

3. **`switch` Statement**: Evaluates the user's choice of operation and executes the corresponding arithmetic operation. It handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's input.

4. **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic operations are performed using `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division. Division includes a check to avoid division by zero, printing an error message if an attempt is made.

5. **`scanner.close()`**: Closes the `Scanner` object to free up system resources.

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers, choose an arithmetic operation, performs the chosen operation, and displays the result. It ensures valid input handling, especially for division by zero.
